Full Stack Software Development: Easca Environmental
=========================================================

This Django project is a combined online shop and lab management system for an environmental science laboratory, offering a variety of soil testing services.

The key features of the app are:

* Customer can 'Order a Sample Kit', they will then receive a sample kit in the post with a reference number
* Customer can 'Submit Sample Details' online
* Staff can 'Receive Sample' into the lab for testing
* Staff can 'Upload Results'
* Customer and Staff can 'View Report' of the sample details and results

This project was developed as the final project in a diploma in Full Stack Software Development through The Code Institute, with consultation with Southern Scientific Services.

* As a register user I should be able to submit the soil sample details online,
using a sample reference number printed on the soil sample kit received in the post.
* As a registered user I should be able to update my user info and change my password.
* As a registered user I should be able to view my order history including the status of samples being processed and view test result reports.
* As a registered user I expect the results to be presented to in a clear report.
* As a registered user I should be provided by an emailed confirmation of my orders change of status.

* As lab staff I should be able to mark samples as 'received' when the sample reaches the lab.
* As lab staff I should be able to upload results of tests.
* As lab staff I should be able explore the full sample archive, provided with the sample details, as well as when and by who the sample was received and tested.
* As lab staff I should be able to filter the sample archive for ease of use.

__Admin User Story__

* As admin I should have all Staff privileges
* As admin I should be able to backup the database as .csv file.

__Wireframes__

Wireframe mock ups were developed using FluidUI and can be viewed here - https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_submit/tree/master/mock-ups

Features
---------

__Existing Features__

* Display soil sample services on offer
* User registration
* Customer can order samples
* Unique sample_reference number is generated for each sample ordered
* Customer can submit the sample details through the 'Your Portal' view. A google map is used for marking the sample position. HTML5 geolocation is used for initialising the marker position Geocoding automatically saves the address
* Customer can view all their samples and access the report with results displayed if the results are available
* Staff can mark the sample as "received" when it comes into the lab, through the 'Lab Portal' view, this processes is time stamped and the logged in staff member is recorded
* Staff can upload the test results, through the 'Lab Portal' view, this processes is time stamped and the logged in staff member is recorded

* Customer is emailed when an order is placed and when results are available
* Pagination of all tables in the Lab and Your Portal

__Future Features__ (outside the scope of this project)

* Barcodes reflecting the sample reference will be printed on stickers which will be applied on each sample kit
* Barcode scanner will be used for dispatching and receiving the samples
* Results will be uploaded from CSV files generated by the lab testing equipment

Bugs.

- if click 'ammend' with no quantity get a server error 500


Development
------------------------

Deployment
------------------------


__Requirements__

The system hosting the app must have a number of python packages installed.
A full list can be found at

https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_submit/blob/master/requirements.txt

Take note that a pip freeze will include django-geoposition-0.3.1, instead of https://github.com/philippbosch/django-geoposition/archive/django-1.11.zip.
Django-geoposition latest release available to install with pip is 0.3.0., however this version will not work with django-1.11 and so the work around branch must be installed.

__System Variables__

The following system variables must be set in the host environment.

* STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, publishable key assigned to you when you register an account with Stripe https://stripe.com/ie
* STRIPE_SECRET, secret key assigned to you when you register an account with Stripe https://stripe.com/ie
* EMAIL_HOST_USER, the email address you will use to send emails to application users.
This can be your personal email address i.e. johndoe@gmail.com. If using gmail you must allow Less Secure App Access in your accounts security settings https://myaccount.google.com/security.
I set up a dummy gmail account, eascatest@gmail.com, so that my personal email was not left vulnerable by downgrading the security.
* EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, your specified email host login password
* SECRET_KEY, generated by django when you start a new app. See setttings.py file
* GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY, assigned when setting up a google maps api account, https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/, insure that both 'Maps' and 'Places' products are available to the key.
* DATABASE_URL, generated when you set up a PostGres database, i.e. when using 'Heroku Postgres' add-on under resources when deploying app on Heroku.

__Deployed vs Development__

__gitignore__

A number files and folders in the local development environment were not deployed with the project. These files and folders were included in a .gitignore file.

As virtual environment wrapper was used for development. The following associated files were omitted from the git repo from the initial git;

* Include/
* Lib/
* Scripts/
* pip-selfcheck.json
* tcl/

As the deployed project uses a Postgres database the locally generated db.sqlite file was also omitted from git repo from the initial git.

All system variables were declared in an env.py file. As many of these variables were passwords this too was from git repo from the initial git. 

If env.py file is not found DEBUG is set to False, this insures that while developing on my local machine the application runs in debug mode but once deployed debug mode is deactivated.

Note: The 'mock-ups' folder was included in the git repo throughout,
normally I would remove the mock-ups from the final deployment, but as the Heroku app was deployed by link to the GitHub repo I thought it better to keep them in the repo.
